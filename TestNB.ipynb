    "Adaptability Metric (calc_adaptibility): The algorithm should adapt to the changes in student's topic weaknesses over time as they respond to more questions. The metric could measure how quickly the system changes the frequency of question topics after detecting a shift in student strength/weakness areas. Ideally, the weak topics don't normally change drastically over 2-3 iterations hence there will be significant overlap. The function looks at all the student's attempts and counts how many attempts have been made for questions containing the initial weakness and the new weakness respectively. This is done using Python's sum function with a conditional logic applied within a generator inside it. After getting the count of attempts for the initial and new weak topics, an adaptability index is calculated. This index is the ratio of new weak topic attempts to initial weak topic attempts. When the adaptability index is closer to 1, it means the system was able to track and shift its focus from the initial weak areas to the new weak areas efficiently. If the index is much smaller than 1, it indicates the system is lagging behind in catching up with the student's current weakness. On the other hand, an index considerably larger than 1 indicates that the system may be overly focusing on the newer weaknesses.\n"
